      <p class="description">
        During my training at Umniah, I was informed that the company uses C#
        and the .NET framework. <br />
        This project was my first time using the .NET framework. I was tasked
        with creating a simple eShop. <br />
        This eShop was made using the ASP.NET MVC pattern with MSSQL for the
        Database, as well as, Bootstrap and CSS for styling the page. <br />
        I have not completed this project, however, this was a great start on
        learning the intricacies of C#, Database Design and webpage design.<br />

      <p class="description">
        This simple webpage was a fun project to work on. It encapsulates many
        avenues of Full-Stack Development and the Software Development Life
        Cycle. <br />
        I discovered how PrizeWheels calculate the odds of what you get from
        them, and how to incorporate it into software. <br />
        Using a JavaScript library called WinWheelJs, I was able to design the
        wheel and have it spin and show the users the prize they won.

      <p class="description">
        I developed this project as my submission for the PwC technical
        assessment. <br />
        It is a basic webpage with a map and a search bar, and when you type a
        city name in the search bar and click search, <br />
        the map loads and positions you directly on that city, and also informs
        you if the city was not found. <br />
        This project was so much fun as I was able to use my skills with APIs,
        JavaScript and Ajax <br />
        to build a web page I am proud of. <br />
        This also helped me learn how to create a better user experience by
        creating a loading screen for when the map takes some time to render.
